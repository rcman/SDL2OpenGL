Thanks for Lazyfoo for this code. 

I just put it in my framework so it can be compiled via scons.

The directory structure is setup with src, include and release directories.

The needed libraries were added to the SConstrct file: glut, GLU and GL

All you need to do is run scons providing you have the correct OpenGL libs installed.
